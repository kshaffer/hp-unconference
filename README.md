Fork Me on Github!
==================

Hello, Hybrid Pedagogy Unconferencites! Welcome to my session! The
Github session will take place on Tuesday, May 28, all throughout
the day.

This is the repository we will be editing through the unconference
The goal is to develop a resource that we can give to others so 
that they can learn how to use Github.

How it'll go
============

Here's how the session will work: throughout the day, I want
to encourage everyone to - at the very least - set up a Github
account and watch this repository.

There are two tracks for this session - the technical track and
the non-technical track. For the technical track, I want you to
fork this repository, go to http://learn.github.com, make some
changes and commit some updates. Remember, we are trying to make
a learning resource here, so commit anything you think will be
helpful - new files, links, folders, whatever.

At 2 PM on Tuesday (Eastern US Time), I'll host a Google Hangout
where we'll talk about the Github approach. I want to focus on a
discussion about the "Github way" (forking, branching, and
decentralization) and how it differs from the Wikipedia way and
the Google Docs way. This is designed to be more of a non-technical
discussion around how a github-like communication model can be used
in education and academia.

The hangout will be recorded and shared on Youtube. If you'd like to
be a part of it, please find me (Barry Peddycord III) on Google+
and add me to one of your circles that you don't really care about.
Please also tweet to me (@isharacomix) so that I know who you are!
